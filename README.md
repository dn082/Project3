# Project3

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I chose to analyze a data set that has information on over 30000 Spotify Songs that came from the Spotify API, and will predict a song's popularity score. This can solve the general idea of the concept of predicting the success of a song based on features it can have, such as danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, tempo, and many other features. 

## THE DATASET
The data I chose to use is a file found from Kaggle called https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs/data. My target variable is track_popularity, and I will be using attributes of an audio to predict the song's popularity.


## WHAT IS REGRESSION AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
Linear regression is the concept of supervised learning being used for prediction, and a statistical and machine learning method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line like a linear line.

A formula to represent the basic idea is
y = beta0 + beta1 * x + epsilon
